Version 2.01 (May 12, 2017)
	* Fixed the bug that prevented '-t' from being recognized. The '-t <max num threads>' now
	  functions the same way as the Perl version of FaQCs.pl

Version 2.02 (July 12, 2017)
	* Fixed bug that did not property parse fastq deflines for paired-end data. This caused a spurious 
	  error message about read 1 and read 2 not matching. Following the FaQCs.pl script, terminial
	  "\.\d$" and "\/\d$" are now removed prior for testing if a pair of reads has a consistent header.

Version 2.03 (Oct 2, 2017)
	* Fixed bug that caused an error to be thrown when the input quality scores were in 
	  Illumina 1.5+ format (score offset == 64).

Version 2.04 (Oct 17, 2017)
	* Fixed bug that generated incorrect plots when 5' and/or 3' trimming (i.e. --5end or --3end)
	  was used. Also corrected bug in the output R script implementation that passed the
	  same quality matrix to the before and after graphs.

Version 2.05 (Oct 18, 2017)
	* Fixed bug  in R script that generated incorrectly normalized nucleotide 
	  content plots (thanks Chien-Chi!).

Version 2.06 (Jan 9, 2018)
	* Fixed bug that caused an error to be thrown when a negative quality score is encountered.
	  As mentioned on the FASTQ wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format), 
	  the old solexa+64 format *does* allow for negative quality scores. As a quick fix, all quality 
	  scores are now clamped to be greater than or equal to zero. The storage formats for the quality
	  offset values (Options::input_quality_offset, Options::output_quality_offset and Options::quality) 
	  have been changed to signed char values (previously these were unsigned int values).

Version 2.07b (Mar 16, 2018)
	* Fixed a bug in the "vector<T>& operator+=()" function in trim.cpp that improperly 
	  truncated the length histogram (as displayed in the output plots). It was possible
	  to completely erase the length histogram, which lead to an R script error (when
	  the R function "read.table()" was passed an empty intput file).
	* Fixed a bug in the "matrix& operator+=" function in matirx.h that improperly tuncated
	  a matrix, leading to a missing file and R script error (similar to above bug with the
	  vector += function).

Version 2.08 (May 1, 2018)
	* Fixed a bug due to the "--polyA" command line argument expecting an argument (it should be a boolean flag).

Version 2.09 (Aug 17, 2018)
	* Added informative error messages to fasta.cpp and FaQCs.cpp to help users diagnose corrupted input files.
